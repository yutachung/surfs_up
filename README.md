## Overview of the Analysis
	The purpose of the analysis was to use data from our SQLite file and extract the data in a meaningful
way. The analysis allows us to apply filters and allows us to visualize the data for specific information.
This means that we would be able to understand the statistics on just one aspect of the data such as
precipitation, temperature, and even the station with the highest traffic.

## Results
	We notice that from the data, the temperatures in December are lower than they are in June. We also
see that the standard deviation is fairly low meaning the data is decently spaced out and consistent. The
interquartile ranges seem to be in fair ranges of each other as well.

## Summary
	One query that could be additionally performed would be to take a look at the precipitation. It may
be possible that we notice that although the min between June and December may not be significant, the
precipitation may be a different story between the two months to get a better understanding on the data
regarding the months. We could also may take a look at the traffic between different stations during the
different months which may provide us an idea of where people are going during the different seasons.
